<p align='justify'>When I started looking through the selected organisations for GSoC 2018, I came accross FreeType. And always being motivated to work on the middleware, I knew that this was the org I will be working for😀. I started reading through the documentation and started learning more about it. I introduced myself to the community on their mailing list. The community was very welcoming. I had many doubts while learning more about the project and the FreeType community was very helpful. FreeType had many prospective projects enlisted on their website for GSoC. I started to work on prospects of doing those projects, eventually I selected "Integrating VFlib's TeX format drivers into FreeType" as my project. After a lot of discussions with my mentors I was eventually able to prepare a draft proposal for the project, and after getting it reviewed from my mentor I finally submitted my final proposal for GSoC.</p>
<p align='justify'>The results were to be announced on April 23. Around 9.30 PM I opened up my PC and started looking for the results. At around 9.58 PM I was able to finally see my dashboard on the GSoC website. It showed 'Active' in front of my project, I was unable to figure out what was that, later I opened the selected projects on the GSoC website and under FreeType I finally saw my name enlisted under Selected Projects and then yeah! I had made it, I was very happy about the selection. I called my parents and my brother to tell them about the result and they were very happy about it. It was very overwhelming and exciting experience. </p>
<p>I would be looking forward to work as good as possible this summer for FreeType under my mentors Werner Lemberg, Suzuki toshiya and Alexei Podtelezhnikov. Thanks to my mentors and org to consider me worthy for their selection list.😀</p>

<p>Looking forward for an exciting summer.....!!</p>
