I am Parth, a systems enthusiast currently working as an Associate at Alphagrep Securities, as a low latency software developer. I have a keen interest in developing robust systems for high frequency trading and have previously worked on different exchanges on both the market data and order entry side of trading software development.

As a software Developer, Iâ€™m inspired by building software stack and have been influenced by algorithms in a big way, especially their applications in solving real-world problems.

Previously in summer 2018 I got selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5826114384035840" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code Intern with FreeType.</a> I worked under the mentorship of some awesome devs at FreeType. <br>

I welcome the chance to connect with you and talk more about complex problems and their solutions. Reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parthw1/" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: .5px dotted;">Linkedin</a>.
