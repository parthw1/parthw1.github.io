excerpt: "About me."

I am Parth, senior undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at<a href="http://www.iiitn.ac.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur. </a> I love to surf Internet and explore new stuff. I am mainly interested in software development and competitive programming.<br>

I like to solve research problems and finding innovative solutions to address them. My research interests lie in Cyber security and privacy, Applied algorithms, and Data science.

So, solving a research problem and building a software application for it is really what I am passionate for! So if you have any research idea or problem which you wish to discuss I am always up for a cup of coffee!

Previously in summer 2018 I got selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5826114384035840" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code Intern with FreeType.</a> I worked under the mentorship of some awesome devs at FreeType. <br>

Currently I am in my 7th semester and pursuing my semester long internship at Tata Innovation labs, Pune. I am working in the cyber security and privacy research team. Here I am working on the cloud resource allocation problem.
