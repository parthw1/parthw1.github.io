I am Parth, currently working as an Associate at Alphagrep Securities, as a low latency software developer in the trading systems team. My work revolves around developing software for trading at different exchanges around the globe. I work on the market data and order entry side of trading software.

As a software Developer, Iâ€™m inspired by building software stack and have been influenced by algorithms in a big way, especially their applications in solving real-world problems.

Previously in summer 2018 I got selected as a <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5826114384035840" target="_blank"> Google Summer of Code Intern with FreeType.</a> I worked under the mentorship of some awesome devs at FreeType. <br>
