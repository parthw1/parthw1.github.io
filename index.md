I am Parth, a computer science student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at<a href="http://www.iiitn.ac.in" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur. </a> I love to surf Internet and explore new stuff. I am currently trying to explore computer science to the fullest ;)<br>
